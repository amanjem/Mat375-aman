%Define the 3x3 matrix A with all 1's in the first row, all 2's in the second row, 
%and all 3's in the 3rd row.
A=[1,1,1;2,2,2;3,3,3]

%Use the size() function to compute the number of rows and columns of matrix A.
%Store these quantities as variables numRows and numCols.
size(A)
[numRows,numCols]=size(A)

%Use the eye() function to create the 4x4 identity matrix.  Store this matrix as I.
I=eye(4)
%Compute the transpose of the matrix A.  Store this transposed matrix as the matrix D.
D=A.'
